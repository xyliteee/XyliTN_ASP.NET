A simgle but beautiful startup page.

Since I don’t think it’s necessary to pay for expensive server costs, this website is currently deployed using my personal computer with a local network penetration setup. Given that my computer can’t be on all the time, the website might be unavailable most of the time. Please download the [release](https://github.com/xyliteee/XyliTN_ASP.NET/releases) and deploy it yourself.
